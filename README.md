### Drag and Drop in React

As way of preparing for project that I planned, I was learning to use drag and drop functionality in react. So I pick this tutorial to re-create Kanban Board and code along to learn. This tutorial is really solid, it uses typescript in Vite react application, code is clean and the whole application is combined in three main components. I would recommend it to anyone learning drag and drop with little warning, that it might be too hard for complete beginners. One or two times I have wished to create something more small and less complex before going to this tutorial. But it is fun and final application is really nice.
